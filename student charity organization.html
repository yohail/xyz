    <p>Last year an unfortunate thing happened to the whole world;<br>
        COVID-19 or Corona virus pandemic was a disease which resulted in the death millions and adittional people being affectd with it.
    because of the pandemic and gravity of it it was necessary for countries to restrict foreign transportations and continuing that lock down of the country too.
<br> And in those times some bussines were failing and others needing help.
So in my home town me and my high school friends started a charity, we collected money by selling masks with our logo on it, tickets and asking for a little sponsers.<br>
After the first succses we kept on it. For the 4<sup>th</sup> 
time we organized a poem night. Using the money we handle weeks of food for the elderly, diabled and the ones in need </p>
    <p>In that organization i fixed some logos, tickets, banners and stickers.</p>
