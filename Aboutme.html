    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <P>My name is Yordanos Haileselassie. i was born in Jigjiga, eastern part of Ethiopia in the somalia region.
        I am the last child of the house.<br>
        Coming from a strict household and having to be both sheltered and exposed to the world i was able to bulid my on pace 
        for my skills in respect to my neighbourhood peers.<br>
        A father teaching me to be punctual. A mother teaching patience. An older brother making me thrive for my self.
        <dd><dl>Sheltered</dl><dt>Being hidden from certain dangers sometimes restrict the expsure needed to evelop additional skills in the real world</dt></dl></dd>
        <dd><dl>Exposed</dl><dt>As much as i was sheltered because of my family there was also certain things i could see and learn from. I was mature in certain things more than other kids at a young age</dt></dd>
        <br>
        I would rate my improvement in my communication skill and social skils from a stable low then an increasing through-out high-school.
